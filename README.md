# Job Insight
## Introduction

**Job Insight** is a social platform tailored for university students, focusing on sharing interview experiences and career development resources to better prepare for the job market.

## Features and Motivation

### Motivation
University students face numerous challenges when preparing for job interviews and stepping into their careers, often lacking practical experience and guidance. Traditional career hubs have typically provided a static, one-way flow of information, which can feel outdated and impersonal. Many of these platforms lack interactive elements, making it difficult for users to engage meaningfully with the content. Furthermore, they are often not user-friendly, featuring clunky interfaces that are not tailored to the needs of tech-savvy college students.

**Job Insight** aims to bridge this gap by offering a dynamic platform for information sharing, facilitated through interactions between students and alumni. Unlike conventional career resources, Job Insight emphasizes a community-driven approach where both content and support are crowd-sourced and highly interactive. This environment not only enhances the relevance and timeliness of the information but also creates a more engaging user experience. By transforming the way career guidance is delivered, Job Insight aims to empower students with the tools and community support they need to successfully navigate their entry into the workforce.
